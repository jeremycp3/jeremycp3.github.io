I will join the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and start my PhD journey under the guidance of [Professor Xiao Huang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~xiaohuang/). And I am currently employed as a researcher at Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd, specializing in the development of algorithms related to image matching, multi-modal matching, image retrieval, and 3D reconstruction. Before assuming this position, I obtained my master's degree from Wuhan University under the supervision of [Professor Ruimin Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c9ZfhU0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). My academic journey commenced with the completion of my undergraduate studies at Dalian University of Technology.

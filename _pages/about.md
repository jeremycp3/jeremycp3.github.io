I am a first-year Ph.D. student in DEEP Lab at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Department of Computing, supervised by [Professor Xiao Huang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~xiaohuang/). And I have been employed as a researcher at Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd, specializing in the development of algorithms related to 3D vision. Before this, I obtained my master's degree from Wuhan University under the supervision of [Professor Ruimin Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c9ZfhU0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and bachelor's degree at Dalian University of Technology.

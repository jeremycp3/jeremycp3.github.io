I will join the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and start my PhD journey under the guidance of [Professor Xiao Huang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~xiaohuang/). And I am currently employed as a researcher at Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd, specializing in the development of algorithms related to image matching, multi-modal matching, image retrieval, and 3D reconstruction. Before assuming this position, I obtained my master's degree from Wuhan University under the supervision of [Professor Ruimin Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c9ZfhU0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). My academic journey commenced with the completion of my undergraduate studies at Dalian University of Technology.

Services
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
